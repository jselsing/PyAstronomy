Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) estimation (Beta Sigma Procedure) 
==============================================================

Estimating the amplitude of noise can frequently only be done after the
data have been taken, because not all noise sources may be known with sufficient
accuracy (if at all) prior to the measurement. Similarly, the details of
the signal to be measured are usually not known as well.
However, in the analysis of data, a reasonable estimate of the amplitude of noise is
usually required to carry out, e.g., a test of goodness-of-fit. Thus arises
the problem of estimating the amplitude (e.g., the variance or standard deviation)
of the noise contribution lacking knowledge about the actual signal.
